    If you are a streamer (or content creator) and would like to use OverTrack to provide details of your games to viewers then this is the page for you.

    <h3>Free OverTrack for partnered streamers</h3>
    <p>
        If you are a partnered streamer then I am happy to upgrade your account to track full game details for free.<br/>
        Just join the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a> and ping me (@Muon) with your battletag you signed up to OverTrack with and your Twitch handle.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can still choose to subscribe at any time if you think that OverTrack is worth supporting.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3>Custom share link</h3>
    <p>
        If you would like a custom share link to your games (instead of the autogenerated battletag-&lt;random string&gt; from the "Share" button) I can generate a custom share link matching your twitch handle.<br/>
        e.g. <a href="https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea">https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Share links can also be configured to only show specific accounts (while the autogenerated link will display all accounts).<br/>
        You may also request multiple share links, for example if you want a separate link for different accounts. 
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3>Bot commands</h3>
    <p>
        OverTrack can be used to provide details about your games upon request in chat. Currently the supported commands are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Current SR</li>
        <li>Last Match</li>
    </ul>
    To use these commands you will need a bot that supports fetching from a URL. For Nightbot this is the <code>$(urlfetch ...)</code> syntax.<br/>
    Configure your bot to respond to a command using the content from one of OverTrack's bot APIs.<br/>

    <br/>
    <h4>Current SR</h4>
    To retrieve current SR use the endpoint <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/sr/&lt;key&gt;</code>.<br/>
    For example if your share link is <a href="https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea">https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea</a> then your share key is <code>eeveea</code>, so your SR endpoint is <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/sr/eeveea</code>.<br/><br/>
    
    Create a bot command and set the text to include the response from this URL. For Nightbot such a command would look like:<br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/sr.png"><br/><br/>

    This command will return the SR of your most recent game. e.g. <br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/sr2.png"> <br/><br/>
    
    If you use multiple accounts and would like this command to return seperate SRs for each account you can add <code>?multiple_accounts=true</code> onto the end of the URL (so it becomes <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/sr/&lt;key&gt;?multiple_accounts=true</code>)
    and OverTrack will return the SR (if known) for all accounts from the last 100 games. e.g.<br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/sr3.png"> <br/><br/>

    <br/>
    <h4>Last Match</h4>
    To retrieve a description of the last match tracked use the endpoint <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/last_match/&lt;key&gt;</code>.<br/>
    This endpoint will describe the result, map, SR, and a link to the game. e.g. <br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/lastmatch.png"> <br/><br/>

    If you would like the link to point to your full games list you can add <code>?game_link=false</code> to the URL used.<br/>
    This will change the game link to be a link to all games visible from your share link. e.g. <br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/lastmatch2.png"> <br/>
    This second option may be desirable if you are not a Twitch partner and are not subscribed to OverTrack (as in this case full game details would not be supported).<br/><br/>

    If you have any issues, queries or suggestions regarding twitch bot support, don't hesitate to get in touch through <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">Discord</a>.<br/>

    <br/>
    <h3>Discord bot</h3>
    OverTrack can also post your games played to Discord. <br/>
    A common use case would be to configure a separate channel specifically for matches. e.g.<br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/discord.png"> <br/>

    If you are interested in integrating the Discord bot with your server shoot me (@Muon) a PM in the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a>.
