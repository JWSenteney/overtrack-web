        If you are a streamer or content creator you may wish to use some of OverTrackâ€™s integrations as additional ways for your viewers to engage with your stream.
    </p>

    <p>
    With OverTrack you can create chat commands that allow your viewers to request information from your most recent matches.
    OverTrack also offers a discord bot which can post each match you have completed to a discord channel.

    <h3>Free OverTrack for partnered streamers</h3>
    <p>
        If you are a partnered streamer then I am happy to upgrade your account to track full game details for free.<br/>
        Just join the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a> and ping me (@Muon) with the BattleTag you signed up to OverTrack with and your Twitch handle.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can still choose to subscribe at any time if you think that OverTrack is worth supporting.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3>Custom share link</h3>
    <p>
        If you would like a custom share link to your games (instead of the autogenerated BattleTag-&lt;random string&gt; from the "Share" button) I can generate a custom share link matching your twitch handle.
        e.g. <a href="https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea">https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Custom share links can also be configured to only show specific accounts, as opposed to the default behavior of the autogenerated links, which will display games from all accounts linked to your OverTrack profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may also request multiple share links - for example, if you want a separate link for different accounts.<br/>
        If you would like a custom share link to your games (instead of the autogenerated BattleTag-&lt;random string&gt; from the "Share" button) shoot me (@Muon) a message in the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a>.<br/>
    </p>

    <h3>Bot commands</h3>
    <p>
        OverTrack can be used to provide details about your games using chat commands. Currently, the supported commands are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Current SR</li>
        <li>Last Match</li>
    </ul>
    Although more are planned and suggestions ar welcome.<br/><br/>

    <p>
        To use these commands you will need a bot that supports fetching from a URL.<br/>
        For Nightbot this is the <code>$(urlfetch ...)</code> syntax and for Ankhbot <code>$readapi(...)</code>.<br/>
        You will need to configure your bot to respond to a command of your choice using the content from one of OverTrack's bot APIs.<br/>
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h4>Current SR</h4>
    To retrieve current SR use the endpoint <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/sr/&lt;key&gt;</code>.<br/>
    For example if your share link is <a href="https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea">https://overtrack.gg/games/eeveea</a> then your share key is <code>eeveea</code>, so your SR endpoint is <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/sr/eeveea</code>.<br/><br/>
    
    Create a bot command and set the text to include the response from this URL. For Nightbot such a command would look like:<br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/sr.png"><br/><br/>

    This command will return the SR of your most recent game. e.g. <br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/sr2.png"> <br/><br/>
    
    If you use multiple accounts and would like this command to return separate SRs for each account you can add<br/>
    <code>?multiple_accounts=true</code> to the end of the URL (so it becomes <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/sr/&lt;key&gt;?multiple_accounts=true</code>) and OverTrack will return the SR 
    (if known) for all accounts with recently played games:<br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/sr3.png"> <br/><br/>

    For these examples I have used <code>!sr</code>, but you may wish to use a different command, as <code>!sr</code> may be confused with song requests.<br/>

    <br/>
    <h4>Last Match</h4>
    To retrieve a description of the last match tracked use the endpoint <code>https://api.overtrack.gg/last_match/&lt;key&gt;</code>.<br/>
    This endpoint will describe the result, map, SR, and a link to the game. e.g. <br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/lastmatch.png"> <br/><br/>

    If you would like the link to point to your games list instead of the specific game, you can add <code>?game_link=false</code> to the URL used.<br/>
    This will change the game link to be a link to all games visible from your share link. e.g. <br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/lastmatch2.png"> <br/>
    This second option may be desirable if you are not a Twitch partner and are not subscribed to OverTrack (as in this case full game details would not be supported).<br/><br/>

    If you have any issues, queries or suggestions regarding twitch bot support, don't hesitate to get in touch through <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">Discord</a>.<br/>

    <br/>
    <h3>Discord bot</h3>
    OverTrack can also post your games played to Discord. <br/>
    A common use case would be to configure a separate channel specifically for matches. e.g.<br/>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/streamer/discord.png"> <br/>

    If you are interested in integrating the Discord bot with your server let me (@Muon) know through PM in the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a>.
