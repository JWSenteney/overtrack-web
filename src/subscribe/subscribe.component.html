        OverTrack has been something that I have worked full time on for many months. It is also a project that I wish to continue to support and add features to.<br/>
        To cover development costs, I ask for a subscription of $4.99 / month. 
        <br/><br/>
        I see OverTrack as a project for the Overwatch community, and to me subscriptions are akin to a Patreon or Twitch subscription; they are a way to support me in running this service.<br/>
        I will also be using the community to steer the direction for new features through the OverTrack <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">Discord</a>,
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OverTrack/">Subreddit</a>, and public <a href="https://trello.com/b/boPHcz5w/overtrack-public-trello">Trello</a>.

        <h4>Complimentary</h4>
        <p>
            Your account has been marked for complimentary OverTrack. This means you can use OverTrack completely free.<br/>
            If you wish to support OverTrack you can still subscribe below, but doing so is optional.

        <p>
            To ensure that no one is paying for something that doesn't work, we require that you play at least 3 games using OverTrack through the trial period.<br/>
            Your trial period will start when you first play a game with OverTrack running and last for 1 week or 10 games, whichever happens second.<br/>
            Once you have played these games and confirmed that you are happy with how OverTrack is functioning you will be able to purchase your subscription to OverTrack.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            If you are attempting to track games and none are showing up in your games list, please check for the following common issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Overwatch is being run as admin, but OverTrack is not</li>
            <li>Overwatch is being run in fullscreen mode on Windows 7</li>
            <li>You are using a laptop with switchable graphics and running Overwatch on the dedicated GPU</li>
            <li>Overwatch is not set to English</li>
            <li>The killfeed is disabled</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
            If none of these apply to you please get in touch through the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack Discord</a>.
