				<h4>Tip!</h4>
				<p>Depending on your system security you may be warned by Windows SmartScreen, or other such similar security system, that overtrack.exe has been prevented from running - in the case of Windows SmartScreen, click on More info, then, Run anyway to proceed. This only needs to be done once..</p>
			</div>

			<p>Once the download has completed you may open overtrack.exe. OverTrack runs directly from this launcher, so make sure the executable is stored somewhere where it won't be deleted (e.g. on your desktop or in your documents folder).</p>

					<p>Upon first launch of the client you will be asked to authenticate/pair the client to your account using the OverTrack site. This should automatically open a page in your browser where you can click the <i>Authenticate Client</i> button: </p>

			<h2>Notes:</h2>
			<p>
				Fullscreen tracking is not available in Windows 7.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to help with bugs and development the client will upload logs and occasionally full screenshots of Overwatch. For normal operation it will only upload small
				sections of the screen, but, when the client encounters oddities, these testing builds can upload more. This means that, for now, images of your whispers may be uploaded
				and the uploaded logs may contain your username.
