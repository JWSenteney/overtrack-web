        It looks like you don't have any games yet... Here's how to get started with OverTrack:
    </p>


    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/overtrack-client/overtrack.exe" class="btn btn-success" target="_blank">Download overtrack.exe</a>
    <br>
    <p>Once the download has completed, run overtrack.exe</p>

    <p>
        Depending on your system security you may be warned by Windows SmartScreen, or other such similar security system, that overtrack.exe has
        been <a href="assets/images/tracker/windows_screen.png" target="_blank">prevented from running</a> - in the case of Windows SmartScreen, click on `More info`,
        then, `Run anyway` to proceed. This only needs to be done once.
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon first launch of the client you will be asked to authenticate/pair the client to your account using the OverTrack site. This should 
        automatically open a page in your browser, and then simply click the "Authenticate Client" button:
    </p>

    <p>If you are not logged in you will instead be presended with the welcome page - simply use the sign-in button and you will be redirected to the authenticate page</p>

    <!--<p>
        If you are unable to log-in, you may need to ask for access our discord server in <a href="https://discord.gg/47HrN6j" target="_blank">#invite-requests</a>.
        Note that our authentication system uses Battle.net integration. Please ensure that you register using the Battle.net account that you wish to track the
        Competitive Overwatch matches of and/or test the OverTrack client with.
    </p>-->
    <h2>Using OverTrack</h2>

    <p>
        OverTrack has a taskbar icon showing the current state and will present toasts (only visbile if Overwatch is not fullscreen):
    </p>

    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/tracker/toasts.png" alt="sample toasts of the client in action"><br>

    <p>
        To ensure SR is tracked correctly you must visit the <i>Play Menu</i> (where the <i>Quick Play</i>, <i>Arcade</i>,
        <i>Compettitive Play</i>, and, <i>Play vs. AI</i> buttons are seen) BEFORE and AFTER each game, as prompted by the toasts. If you are in a group, you must 
        ensure that you are group leader before continuing, or your SR will be obscured by the "Unavaliable while in a group" text and padlock and will NOT be tracked.
    </p>

    <p>
        To close the client, right click the tray icon and select <i>Quit</i>
    </p>
    <img class="tut-image" src="assets/images/tracker/menu.png" alt="Quit button" />

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>
        Overwatch must be running on either your <b>Primary Monitor</b> in fullscreen, or, in <b>Borderless Windowed</b> mode (any monitor) for the overtrack.exe client
        to function. Fullscreen tracking is not yet avaliable in Windows 7.
    </p>
        <!-- I feel like this short paragraph either goes first or in the notes section; having trouble finding a spot for it in the wall of text that follows that would be natural to introduce it in -->

    <p>
        In order to help with bugs and development the client will upload logs and occasionally full screenshots of Overwatch. For normal operation it will only upload small
        sections of the screen, but, when the client encounters oddities, these testing builds can upload more. This means that, for now, images of your whispers may be uploaded
        and the uploaded logs may contain your username.
    </p>

    <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
    <p>
        The OverTrack client watches the Overwatch game screen and does NOT interact with it in any form. However, there is a minute chance that Blizzard Anticheat may
        confuse OverTrack with a "pixel-bot" (a type of cheat that watches the screen and moves the cursor according to what colours/images are on screen (e.g. health bars)).
        While this is extremly unlikely, we cannot guarantee your accounts safety and hold no liability for actions Blizzard may take.
